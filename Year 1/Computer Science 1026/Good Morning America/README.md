<h2>üßê Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:
* Prompt the user for various pieces of information about the desired breakfast
* Once all the information has been entered, the program will compute and display the amount of money (including tax) charged for the customer‚Äôs breakfast
* The program will compute the total cost of the order with additional taxes of 13%
* The program is able to compute the total breakfast cost for an entire table of customers
* The program accepts inputs whether they contain upper-case or lower-case characters
* The program is robust to leading and trailing spaces, including cases when multiple spaces separate words in input lines
* The program detects and reports invalid input
* The program is robust to users entering input other than numbers when quantities are requested
