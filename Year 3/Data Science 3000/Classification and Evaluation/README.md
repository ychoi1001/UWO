We will introduce classification through the logistic regression algorithm. We will see how logistic regression can be formulated as a maximum likelihood learning method, and we will see the role regularization can play in training a logistic regression model, Also, we will see several ways to evaluate the performance of a classifier. We will finish up with a discussion of multiclass classification and the importance of using a test set for evaluation.
