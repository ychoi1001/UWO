By this project, you will lay the foundation for Supervised Learning. Also, you will define important terms such as Model, Parameter, Training Loss, and Estimation. These concepts will be discussed at the example of Ordinary-least-square Regression, as well a Median regression, which is a robust regression technique. On the practical side, you will get a introduction to the Pandas Package, an learn how set up a model and estimate its parameter in Python.
