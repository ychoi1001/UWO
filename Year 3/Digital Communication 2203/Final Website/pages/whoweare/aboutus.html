        <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>The London Animal Adoption Center was established in 2021 by animal-loving Olivia and Sunny in London, Ontario, Canada. When we were founded, we focused on saving cats because we were cat mothers! But now we're focusing not only on cats but also on saving dogs. Currently, about 20 members are active, and our large volunteer network helps spread news and information about our adoption programs and raise funds for the operation of the center. Our goal is to create a day when all pets can enjoy a happy life away from threats and unhappiness. We made a deep oath that we would never turn a blind eye to dogs or cats in need of our help. We believe that all pets deserve the best. Therefore, we try to ensure that all dogs and cats receive the highest level of care. The London Animal Adoption Center team will give the animals in our care the best chance to make a fresh start in a happy new house. The London Animal Adoption Center values adoption, education, and neutralization. We help our animals meet their best owners. We neutralize our animals by having them checked up by a professional veterinarian. We are trying to educate the public about responsible pet ownership, including microchips, neutralization, and training. For the happiness of animals, we give advice and support to owners who welcome new pets.
